Problem Statement:
Monk loves to preform different operations on arrays, and so being the principal of Hackerearth School, he assigned a task to his new student Mishki. Mishki will be provided with an integer array A of size N and an integer K , where she needs to rotate the array in the right direction by K steps and then print the resultant array. As she is new to the school, please help her to complete the task.

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int num;
	cin >> num;    

	while(num!=0)
	{
		int n,k;
		cin>>n>>k;

		int arr[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
			cin>>arr[i];
		
		int a= k%n;

	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		if(i<=a-1)
			cout<<arr[n-a+i]<<" ";
		else
			cout<<arr[i-a]<<" ";
	}
	cout<<endl;

		num--;
	}

}
